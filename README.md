## *S.E.C.U.R.E.D. (Securely, Encrypting Communication U Read Every Day)*
We are S.E.C.U.R.E.D., the amalgamation of two elite task forces—*MCAT* and *SINT*—forged with a common purpose. Under the leadership of Agent Phantom, our enigmatic commander with unparalleled strategic prowess, we embark on a mission of utmost importance. Our objective is to create a messaging app named Bull-it, and within its very core, implement an unbreakable ECC algorithm. *MCAT*, with their exceptional prowess in cryptography, tirelessly crafts the algorithm, weaving a digital fortress of unmatched security. Meanwhile, *SINT*, armed with their expertise in app development and innovation, breathes life into Bull-it, transforming it into a seamless and user-friendly platform. As S.E.C.U.R.E.D., we are the guardians of secure communication, operating under the watchful eye of Agent Stratos, our guiding force. Together, we ensure that messages traverse the digital realm with impenetrable protection, carrying out our mission with unwavering resolve and covert excellence. The world may never know the true extent of our efforts, but they shall forever benefit from the shield of encryption we weave

## *MCAT* *(Mathematical Cryptographic Advancement Taskforce)* 
We are MCAT. An elite team forged in the crucible of secrecy and expertise, we stand as the vanguard of cryptographic defense. Each member of our team possesses unparalleled skills, honed through years of relentless training and unwavering dedication. Led by the brilliant codebreaker, Agent Cipher, and his colleagues, Agent Nightshade and Agent Phantom, our mission is clear: to create an impenetrable cryptographic algorithm using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that will safeguard the world's most sensitive information. Our objective is to program this masterpiece into a groundbreaking messaging app known as Bull-it (built by *SINT*), fortifying it with unbreakable security. We are the silent protectors, the unsung heroes who operate in the shadows, armed with unparalleled expertise and boundless determination. We could give you the answers to solve our algorithm, but we would have to kill you.

Information:
- Our curve is $135y^2=x^3-435x+299$
- We are using *Serpent* for our asymmetric encrypt/decrypt

## *SINT* *(Secure Interface Network Taskforce)* 
We are *SINT*, a covert alliance of unparalleled minds assembled to create the revolutionary messaging app, Bull-it. Guided by the enigmatic Agent Sentinel and his colleagues, Agent Thunderhawk and Agent Mirage, we embed the sacred algorithm of the legendary *MCAT* team into the very heart of our creation. With each member's exceptional skillset, we stand at the precipice of redefining secure communication. Yet, as whispers of our name spread through the shadows, the secrets we hold, buried within our creation, remain shielded from prying eyes. We are SINT, weaving an enigmatic tapestry of innovation, where the boundary between light and darkness becomes indistinguishable, and the true power of Bull-it lies hidden, waiting to be revealed.
